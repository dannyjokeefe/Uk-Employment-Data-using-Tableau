Dashboard showing Data of employment in the UK
# UK Employment Data Dashboard (2011–2014)

This project showcases my data visualization skills using Tableau with a focus on analyzing employment changes across various UK industries and cities between 2011 and 2014.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using a dataset of UK employment changes, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore:

- **Top 10 industries by employment change**
- **Employment trends by city**
- **Total employment distribution across cities**
- **Top sub-industries contributing to job growth**

The dashboard enables users to quickly understand where employment increased the most, both in absolute numbers and in relative percentage terms.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities** saw the highest employment growth (+134,655).
- London had the highest total employment (~4.7 million).
- Cities like **Manchester** and **Liverpool** showed notable average percentage growth.
- **Real Estate Activities** and **Services to Buildings** were leading sub-industries in terms of job increases.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For creating interactive and visually compelling dashboards.
- **Dataset**: [UK Employment Data (2011–2014)](./UK%20Employment%20Data%20(1).twbx) provided in TWBX format.
